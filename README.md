# Queue
iOS App which acts as a Queue system for organizations in meetings. Users will be able to add themselves to the queue and receive a push notification when it is their turn to contribute.

(Currently in the process of switching over to Swift 2, running into issues with the Pods used) Using this as a test Repo for other stuff now. Test, test.
